        Getting Started:
    
    </subheading>
    <p>To kickstart your journey in making an HTML website, you need a text editor to write your code. 
        Fortunately, you have a plethora of options at your disposal. For Windows users, Notepad offers 
        a simple yet effective platform to craft your HTML files. If you're on a Mac, TextEdit provides 
        a similar function, allowing you to create and edit HTML documents with ease. For those seeking more 
        advanced features, Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code are popular choices among developers. Once you've 
        chosen your preferred text editor, it's time to organize your project. Create a dedicated folder on your 
        computer where you'll store all the files related to your website. This structured approach will help you 
        stay organized as your project evolves and grows in complexity. With your tools in place and your workspace 
        organized, you're ready to dive into the exciting world of HTML web development.</p>

        <p>
            With your text editor selected and your project folder created, it's time to start coding your HTML website. 
            Begin by creating a new HTML file within your project folder. This file will serve as the foundation of your 
            website's structure. Open your text editor, create a new file, and save it with a ".html" extension, such as 
            "index.html". Once your HTML file is created, you can start building the basic structure of your website. 
            This includes defining the document type, setting the language, and adding tags. Remember, HTML provides the 
            structure of your website, so take your time to craft a well-organized layout that reflects the content you want 
            to present. As you progress, you can add additional HTML elements to incorporate text, images, links, and other 
            media to enrich the user experience. Don't worry if you're not familiar with all the HTML tags right awayâ€”learning 
            and experimentation are key parts of the process. As you become more comfortable with HTML, you can explore advanced 
            techniques and features to further enhance your website's functionality and aesthetics. Below is a well-organized PDF 
            file that lists and describes the function of each tag.

            Content and Style:

        </subheading>
        <p>
            After setting up the basic structure of your HTML file, it's time to bring your website to life with content and style. 
            Start by adding meaningful content between the body tags. You can include headings using h1, h2, and other heading tags 
            to organize your content hierarchically. Paragraphs are created with the p tag, allowing you to write blocks of text. To 
            make your site more engaging, include images using the img tag and links using the a tag. Once you have your content in 
            place, consider enhancing your website's appearance with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS allows you to apply styles 
            to your HTML elements, making your site visually appealing and user-friendly. You can add CSS directly within your HTML 
            file using style tags inside the head section, or you can create a separate CSS file and link it to your HTML using the 
            link tag. For example, to center images, texts, and links of your website and style the headings, you might add the 
            following CSS:
        </p>

            With the foundation of your website established and styled, it's time to explore the possibilities of adding 
            interactivity and dynamic features using JavaScript. JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that allows 
            you to create engaging user experiences by manipulating HTML and CSS on the fly. Start by adding a simple script 
            to your HTML file. You can place JavaScript directly within your HTML using the script tag or link to an external 
            JavaScript file for better organization. For instance, you could add a basic JavaScript function that displays an 
            alert message when a button is clicked:
        </p>

        <div class="centered-button-container">
            <button class="styled-button" onclick="handleClick()">Click Me</button>
        </div>

            Now that you have a functional and interactive website, it's important to ensure that it is accessible and 
            performs well across different devices and browsers. Begin by testing your website on various browsers such as 
            Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge to ensure consistent behavior and appearance. Pay attention to any discrepancies
             and address them using browser-specific CSS rules or JavaScript polyfills if necessary. Additionally, consider the 
             responsiveness of your design. A responsive website adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a 
             seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
